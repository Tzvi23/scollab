# StudentCollab
A student SO-like platform for file share, asking questions etc.

This platform gives users the ability to register as students in a listed higher education facility (university, college, institute etc.) and share questions, files and ideas.

The platform is built around "rooms" that have topics and threads per topic. Each user can create a thread and reply to other users' threads.
